					<h3>Perl, Youth Education, and Civic Hacking</h3>
					<h2>A possible crossroad?</h2>

						<h2>So, folk have been talking;</h2>
						<p class="fragment">There are relatively few people involved in perl...</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							re: dc.pm discussions re: getting people interest in perl again
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Is that what we want?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Well... <span class="fragment">The <span style='color:#EA6'>National Science Foundation</span> DID pay <i style='color:#EA6'>COBOL</i> programmers over $400/hr preparing for Y2K</span> <span class="fragment" style='color:#FDA'>(or about $570/hr in today's money.)</span></p>
						<p class="fragment">Perhaps, then, <span style='color:#EA6'>YAPC:NA 2013</span>'s 300 attendees are a tad more 'ninja' than <span style='color:#EA6'>Pycon 2013</span>'s 2500?</p>

						<h2>So, Perl was big in the 90's</h2>
						<p class="fragment">...and there'll definitely be legacy systems out there that'll need our help. </p>
						<p class="fragment">But even with some 60% of organizations, in 2012, still using <i style='color:#EA6'>COBOL</i>, 36% of those actively want to migrate away.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Likewise, my own organization is slowly abandoning its venerable and propriety Perl framework in favor of drupal and python based REST apis.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Parts of these newer systems have been demonstrably slower and harder to maintain than our older Perl code... <span class="fragment">but our director of IT chose them because he found they had <span style='color:#EA6'>thriving developer communties.</span></span></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							re: computerworld 2012 survey saying 60% of organizations still using some or a lot of cobol
							re: 36% of managers saying they want to migrate away from it

						<h2>In other words...</h2>
						<p>Perl will likely only be relied upon in the future if we not only can consistently generate new generations of <span style="color:#FDA">perl mongers</span> but deploy them in visible ways as well.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>So how do we do that?</h2>
						<p>I've a few stupid ideas <span class="fragment">... so bear with me.</p>

						<h2>Youth Education</h2>
						<p class="fragment">When WE were young(er) and making cheesy 1995-style websites from our dorm rooms, <span style='color:#EA6'>Perl</span> was the way to grow.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Now, it's relatively obscure, despite how much of it is out there <span class="fragment">and not only are there shiny new languages</span> <span class="fragment">but entire CMS frameworks</span> <span class="fragment">and no-code-necessary hosts ready to use.</span></p>
						<p class="fragment">There's no impetus for potential new talent to pick up <span style='color:#EA6'>Perl</span> and think to themselves<span class="fragment"> ...I want to use this!</span></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							re: the raspberry pi talk from pycon '13
							re: can it be demonstrated that there's still a need for perlers out there?
							re: kids who HAD to program leading to high applications at university
							re: since depletion of interest due to it becoming too easy to USE computers
							re: 500 down to 200 or so; not able to find 80 or 90 kids
							re: now have to bring students up to level where they used to start at
							re: due to business model requiring hardware NOT to be programmable
							re: but the PC which is very programmable must CHOOSE to program rather than choose NOT to
							re: 2006 devising a machine to deal with this problem
							re: niche item had to be programmable
							re: niche item had to be interesting (games, graphics, video)
							re: niche item had to be robust (shoved into a bag without breaking)
							re: niche item had to be cheap/affordable ($25)
							re: arduino wasn't quite enough (not interesting enough for children)
							re: after some scary numbers (50kdown for 10kpis) they found help
							re: premier finell & rs components had same concern for future of strong engineering base
							re: 100000 orders first day (15 minutes of product on their initial estimate)
							re: millions have been sold
							re: has done things like put a space program in the reach of a primary/highschool budget

						<h2>The Raspberry Pi</h2>

					</section>

						<h2>The issue at hand...</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class='fragment'>There was a time when, pursuing the interesting things one wanted to do, one had to choose NOT to program a PC.</li>
							<li class='fragment'>This created a generation of child programmers who showed up at the doorstep of Cambridge already with advanced knowledge.</li>
							<li class='fragment'>So much so that their engineering programs had to spend weeks teaching them what they did not know they did not know.</li>
							<li class='fragment'>In the time since, as PCs and consoles evolved, the impetus to learn to program went away.</li>
							<li class='fragment'>And now Cambridge is having trouble finding enough students, and has to spend extra time catching them up to what the courses used to be able to take for granted.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>And lo, Raspberry Pi was born</h2>
						<h3>with specific goals in mind</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class='fragment'>If a new generation of coders was to be raised, the desire to code starting young had to be reintroduced.</li>
							<li class='fragment'>This interface had to be programmabe</li>
							<li class='fragment'>This interface had to be interesting</li>
							<li class='fragment'>This interface had to be robust</li>
							<li class='fragment'>This interface had to be affordable</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A great success</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class='fragment'>100,000 orders were placed on their first day... exhausting their original production estimates within 15 minutes.</li>
							<li class='fragment'>Thankfully, <span style='color:#FDA'>Premier Farnell</span> and <span style='color:#FDA'>RS Electronics</span>, recogizing the same decline in engineering students, stepped up and now do the heavy lifting production under license.</li>
							<li class='fragment'>The things folk have been using the Raspberry pi <i>for</i>&nbsp; has gone far beyond anything the foundation had imagined.</li>
							<li class='fragment'>At PyCon 2013, days of raspberry pi centric workshops brought the device and kids with little to no experience together, and many new enthusiasts were born.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>By one simple choice</h3>
						<h2>Python benefits from this</h2>
						<h3 class='fragment' style='color:#FDA'>But it could have been perl</h3>
